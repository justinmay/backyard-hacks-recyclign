Rothy's Copper Flat,"They're lightweight, comfortable, and come in a bewildering variety of shapes, colors, and sizes. The knit uppers are made of 100 percent post-consumer plastic bottles, and the foam components are made from other recycled shoes.

30A Recycled Henley,"As far as comfy clothes go, a Henley is a must-have. 30A's Henleys are made of 50 percent recycled plastic (equalling about eight water bottles) with buttons made of coconuts. Pair them with jeans, and you've got an effortlessly put-together outfit. They're just the right thickness for when there's a slight chill in the air, or they can be layered over on colder days.

Suga Mat,"Surfers need wet suits to conserve body heat in cold water. So it's unfortunate that those wet suits are made from a material that never breaks down and is made from petroleum-derived products. Suga—based in Encinitas, California—collects used and damaged wet suits and repurposes them into dense, comfortable, and attractive yoga mats. As a bonus, their irresistible smell will remind you of the ocean.",79,"mat, yoga",100,https://www.sugamats.com/buy/sugamats,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a332116d76e870be82feb7a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/06-SugaMat-SOURCE-Suga.jpg
Everywhere 100% Recycled T-Shirt,"I've gone through countless cycles of buying the cheapest plain shirt I can find because they all seem to be clingy, see-through, or lose shape immediately. Everywhere’s recycled T-shirt in grey, on the other hand, is the best plain tee I’ve ever owned. It’s comfy, slimming, and stays put. Some unisex T-shirts are very obviously cut for men’s bodies, but this one looks good on all body types. The white version could stand to be a bit thicker, as you can see a slight outline of a bra underneath, but it’s better than most women’s white tees.",24,shirt,,https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxpwRKU68aihzzxnUypWAUUiArC9rzhPkKBXKT15nDLFE7UixagVY6ghvRcY6MJf578?cid=5cb63f20b9c1161402febad5,https://media.wired.com/photos/5eb2002a0371f8083eb2ceb6/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-Everywhere-t-shirt-SOURCE-Everywhere.jpg
Bureo Ahi,"Discarded plastic fishing nets are a big threat to ocean wildlife. California- and Chile-based Bureo keeps discarded fishing nets out of the water by turning them into recycled plastic products, like skateboards, sunglasses, and clothes.

It has Carver's patented trucks that let you pump the skateboard and feel like you're surfing on land.

Girlfriend Collective Compressive High-Rise Legging,"Cheap leggings fall apart quickly and are often a little see-through. The Girlfriend Collective's compressive leggings are as high-quality as they are high-waisted (I have a long torso, and these come up above my belly button). They aren't see-through and they stay in place, so there's no pulling and readjusting when you're moving around. They're made of 25 plastic bottles and 79 percent recycled polyester. The packaging is also made of 100 percent recycled materials and is recyclable. I tried the brand's Paloma Bra too, which is made of 11 plastic bottles and is just as comfortable and supportive as the leggings.",68,"pants, legging, yoga",,https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxpwSJbj7MaVB4QFrYiixsEe4sFmYAfoyxx3ggqWpVRVpEz2TE3htbMyyy27V5xGjAi?cid=5cb63f20b9c1161402febad5,https://media.wired.com/photos/5eb9c6dd3b4719b49ff88ac8/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-20200218_Girlfriend_Essentials_0391.jpg

Freitag F640 Rollin,"Freitag has been using recycled truck tarpaulins to make bags since the 1990s. But its Tarp on PET collection combines truck tarps with material spun from PET plastic bottles. Freitag uses recycled plastic yarn for the inner lining and more flexible parts of the bag. That makes the bag much lighter, while the heavy-duty truck tarps add durability where the bag needs it most. The Rollin is its roll-top shoulder bag, which you can take to work, and it expands to carry your entire weekly groceries on the way home.",240,bag,,https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxkgdhVRD1tvs8S24vCRH1w9KDmTGBpMDzZZ8wahKpucVgzK6WhPwU8mqbRLpyarh4X?cid=5cb63f20b9c1161402febad5,https://media.wired.com/photos/5cba61eea02acc53947a8e19/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/freitag-f640-rolling-single-olivernanzig-rgb-(1).jpg
Patagonia Nano Puff,"Patagonia has been recycling plastic soda bottles into fleece since 1993, so they've been at this longer than most companies. Today, most of its Capilene base layers, shell jackets, board shorts, and fleece incorporate recycled polyester. The iconic Nano Puff—aka the most useful jacket you will ever own—has a 100 percent recycled polyester shell, with PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco that is made up of 55 percent recycled content.

It's also packaged in recycled, recyclable material, and it's dishwasher-safe for when you want to start next year's seed crop.

BAGGU Reusable Bags,"These affordable bags are made from 40 percent recycled nylon and come in a huge array of colors and styles. They're durable, with straps that are big enough to make carrying heavy loads comfortable. Each standard-sized tote can hold as much stuff as three of the plastic bags you'd usually get at the store.

Solgaard Carry-On Closet Plus,"I like all of Solgaard's products, but this one is my favorite. This hard-shell suitcase isn't cheap, but I've taken it on several trips and it still looks as good as new. This version is technically just bigger than domestic requirements, but it'll be accepted as a carry-on by 95 percent of airlines. The included optional closet is collapsible and removable, and I also like the integrated TSA lock and USB port. The best part? Solgaard's products are made with things like recycled bottles. Some are made entirely of ocean plastics. For each product sold, the company removes five pounds of plastic from the ocean. —Louryn Strampe",225,"carryon, suitcase",,https://cna.st/p/2hc5hQAHwfj8VPYK7Qk9GwUbxRSgyWyQM4qy5vcfAxpbGzXAtiUmdgWxdkjafYdDA1GvT9ZHLB9nX9inp4zsyrqA31rApyUcBvsy9phSMpc?cid=5cb63f20b9c1161402febad5,https://media.wired.com/photos/5e9536bf7b575f0008effd67/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/Gear-Solgaard-Carry-On-Closet-Plus-SOURCE-Solgaard.jpg
Noho Move chair,"Noho’s Move is a surprisingly comfortable chair made from end-of-life carpets and fishing nets removed from the ocean. It looks rigid, but the chair flexes so you can bend, stretch, and lean back. In other words, it lets you move, hence the name. The design doesn't stick out, mimicking the classic shape of the 1950s Tulip Chair, but it remains an elegant addition to a home.
